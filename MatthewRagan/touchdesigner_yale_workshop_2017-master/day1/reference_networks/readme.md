## Day 1 - Reference Networks ##
_1.5.17_

There's always more material to talk about than we can cover in the time we have togehter. To that end, I want to make sure that you have some additional reference materail that's specific to what we're covering in our workshop.

This is likely to contian networks that we've talked about specifically, as well as networks that we haven't - but whose concepts might well be useful to you. 

There are a ton of additional support materials on the web these days, but finding the thing you're after is often the hardest part. I'm hoping that this might give you a push in the right direction when it comes to searching for answers to your questions... at least in the intial stages.
