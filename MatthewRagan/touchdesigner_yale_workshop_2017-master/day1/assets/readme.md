## Assets ##

All projects end up needing some assets to help keep them running or oragnized.

Generally it's a bad idea to put too many assets in your git repository - this is mostly because they end up getting added to your commit history, which can add up over time - especially if you're dealing with large images or videos.

My rule of thumb is to only include images in my assets git repository, and usually as few as possible. These typically end up looking like calibration plates, or the like. Other files that might end up in assets are icons or other UI images that are used in the application itself. 

Thinking about this from a 30,000 foot perspective, this is a great place to think through organizing things that are needed for your application to run. If you're app is going to break without something, this is a great place to keep it organized.
