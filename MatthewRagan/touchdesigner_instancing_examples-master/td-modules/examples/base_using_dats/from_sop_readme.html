<h1>Using DATs For Instancing</h1>
<h2>Using a SOP and Point Attributes</h2>
<hr>
<p>Similar to our previous example this explores the use of a updating scale values - only rather than directly updating a table - which can be computationally expensive, this instead updates a dictionary in storage. Values in storage are treated native data types, while cell contents are strings which then need to be correctly type cast before instancing - this process is invisible to the user, but adds to the computational overhead involved in working with DATs. This instead uses an expression in a point SOP to retrieve a value from storage.
<br>
<br>
To see how this process is working open the network and first look at the 'text1' DAT - here you'll find the scrip that is run at a regular interval which is updating storage. Next look at the point SOP to see how that value is retrieved and assigned for scale in the SOP pipeline. At a small scale the computation time for this approach is negligible - how / if it would work at scale is worth exploring in order to better understand what approach you might want to use for a project.
