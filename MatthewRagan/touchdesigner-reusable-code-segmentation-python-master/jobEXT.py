'''
	The Specific class handles the requirements that are specific to a 
	particular job. We separate these functions into two classes as there
	are always cases where a particular venue has a particular requirement
	that doesn't fit with the schema of a larger system. We might find
	that one of these functions can be generalized and pulled into the
	General class, but if you're writing something that's specific to a
	single job or venue, this is the place for that function.
