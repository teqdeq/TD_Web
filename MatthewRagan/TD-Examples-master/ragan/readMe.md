## Overview ##

Here  you'll find an extensive library of the code examples that I've put together for courses, the [TouchDesigner forum](http://derivative.ca/Forum/), and the [TouchDesigner Help Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/touchdesignerhelp/) on Facebook. The examples here run the gamut of various applications and techniques, and as it stands this repo is a bit of a mess - in terms of organization. In the coming months I should have a better organizational structure, and better documentation. These things just take time. Meanwhile, download the code pack, and look through some examples.

Happy Programming
