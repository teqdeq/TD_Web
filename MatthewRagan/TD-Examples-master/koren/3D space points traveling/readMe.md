Hi,Here is example for moving from point to point  in 3D space .
The transition behavior based on a motion curve that you can edit .

Use “S” and “W” keys to move inward and back from the selected point.

There are still bugs, try to press  “force cook” at different times to solve the problem .
feel free to offer solution for the shaken camera or any other improvement and share it with us all.

hope you will like it
Barak.
