File 1.
	- open AudioViz.1.toe
	-  explain terminology:
		○ CV: controlvoltage
		○ Gate: on/off value
		○ VCO: Voltage Controlled Oscillator - Voltage controls the pitch
		○ VCF: Voltage Controlled Filter - Voltage Controls the cutoff or bypass frequency
		○ VCA: Voltage Controlled Amplifier - literally a multiplication of one value with another
		○ Envelope Generator: also called a ADSR which stands for Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release
	- Add 2 Audio Oscillator CHOPs and set their type to Ramp and Square
	- Turn down your Speakers, append an Audio Device Out and listen in. 
	- Combine the 2 Oscillator CHOPs using a Math CHOP
	- See how the Amplitude is now -2 to plus 2 --> something Audio doesn't like
	- Add Audio Dynamics CHOP and enable Limiter
	- Append an Audio Filter CHOP
		○ Low Pass: everything below Frequency is passed
		○ High Pass: everything above Frequency is passed
		○ Band Pass: everything around Frequency is passed
		○ Band Reject: specified Frequency is cut
		○ Look at Logarithmic Frequency Control over Linear
	- Append and Audio Oscillator CHOP to watch Filter effect
	- Append Math CHOP as the VCA

File 2.
	- Explore Gates and Envelopes
	- Add a Button COMP and set Type to Momentary
	- Activate Viewer of Button so we can click it
	- Append a Trail CHOP to see the state value of the Button
	- Append an Trigger CHOP on Button and explore default behaviour through trail
		○ Especially explore what Sustain means
	- Set the values of the trigger to control the filter to: 
		○ Attack Length: 0.06 S
		○ Peak Length: 0
		○ Decay Length: 0.06
		○ Release Length: 0.3
		○ Decay Shape: Ease Out
	- As we are using Logarithmic values in the Filter, append a math and convert the range from 0-1 to 4-2
	- Try out what different Filter types do to the Sound
	- Add another trigger to contrl the VCA:
		○ Attack Length: 0.08
		○ Peak Length: 0.1
		○ Decay Length 0.17
		○ Release Length: 0.3
	
File 3.
	- Controlling Pitch via the Input to the Oscillator
	- Add a Panel CHOP and reference Button to get Panel u and v value
	- Use Select CHOPs to control osc1 with u and osc2 with v
	- Going stereo: copy everything to audio dynamics CHOP and create second chain
	- Use Merge CHOP to bring both chains together
	- Change all the oscillator frequencies to individual ones: 440, 555, 160, 990

File 4.
	- Look at it through X/Y scope
	- Append a Null CHOP to Audio Dynamics
	- Append a CHOP To SOP to Null CHOP
	- Fix the warnings
	- Create Render Setup:
	- Append Geo COMP to ChopTo SOP
	- Add Camera, Constant Material and Render TOP (render to parent panel size)
	- Add a Null TOP and call it bg
	- Open Parent Viewer and Parent Parameters
	- Set the BG TOP parameter
	- Place a new Panel CHOP and select u, v and select
	- Replace the Button as a source with the panel and control Synth from Panel

File 5.
	- Add a Feedback effect

File 6.
	- Add Particles
	- Control by Leap Motion or Zig Sim
