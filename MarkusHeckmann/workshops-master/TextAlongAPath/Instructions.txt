	- Create a circle SOP and append a Null SOP
	- Get the positional values with a Sop To CHOP for only tx ty
	- We need the rotation for a rectangle to be aligned with 2 neighbouring points
	- Tan a = dy/dx --> but not good enough for y < 0 --> use atan2 which solves for all quadrants
	- To get dx and dy use Slope CHOP
		○ Method is Previous and Current Sample
		○ Timeslice Off
	- Weird first sample is because of the first "previous" being not well defined
	- Add Extend CHOP and set to cycle
	- and divide result by me.time.rate as slope and speed work on a fps basis
	- Use function CHOP to calculate atan2 which is the rotation
	- Rename to rot
	- Merge with the initial x and y
	- Create a square, Render instance setup with the rotation and pos as instance source

File 1:
	- Calculate the distance between 2 points by using Math:Length
	- Rename to scale for instancing
	- For the Text we need to load each letter into a slice of a 2D Array
	- For ascii we can say that we require letters from char 32 to char 256
	- Add Table DAT with 224 rows
	- Append Eval DAT with expression: char(me.inputCell.row+32)
	- Read into Texture3D TOP (watch for -1 offset for me.time.frame as frame is index 1)
	- Create a pettern CHOP with Ramp Samples and use as textureIndex

File 2:
	- Animate with Noise
	- Append Noise CHOP after Circle SOP
	- Animates only in z because of Normals --> explore circle Normals
	- Use SOPTo and CHOPTo to assign Normals
	- Another way to animate this would be via Noise Channels
	- Append a Null CHOP after SOPTo and switch input for 2 Noise Channels, then animate with Speed

File 3:
	- Get some text and paste into a text DAT
	- Change the Pattern to be a constant type and convert text to int using ord > point out slowness
	- ord(op('text2').text[me.sampleIndex])-32
	- Disconnect input of pattern and use length of text to specify the Length of the pattern
	- Use trim to only take text length of waveform
	
Still Time? 
	- Draw path with Record CHOP
