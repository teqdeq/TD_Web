# OPColorSetter

Drop this component into your file and change the operator colors for your project. 

This component needs to be present in your project if you want the colors to stick when restarting as colors changed with the tscript uicolors command are not persistant.

A good use for this Component would be to set the colors you like, drop the component into the palette and now have access to your personalized colors in all files.
